+# code2gist üì¶
 
 `code2gist` is a Python package that makes sharing your code projects easier than ever. With a simple command, it lets you upload your code files to GitHub's Gist. `code2gist` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/code2gist/).
 
-The package works hand-in-hand with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4's 'Browse with Bing' feature. This compatibility allows you to present substantial code bases to the model in a single instance, eliminating the need to split your code into smaller parts.

-### Adding code2gist Directory to the PATH Environment Variable
+### Adding code2gist Directory to the PATH Environment Variable üë£
 
 Here are step-by-step instructions to add the code2gist directory to your PATH environment variable on Windows:
 
 1. Open the **Control Panel**.
 2. Navigate to **System and Security > System**.
 3. Click on the **Advanced system settings** link on the left panel.
 4. Click **Environment Variables**.
 5. Under the **System Variables** section, find and double-click the variable **PATH**.
 6. Click **New**.
 7. Add the directory where code2gist is installed. For example, if you have Python 3.11 installed, the directory might look like this: `C:\...\Python311\Scripts`
 8. Click **OK** to close all windows and save the changes.
 
-After following these steps, your system should recognize code2gist commands from any directory in the command line.

-### GitHub Token
+### GitHub Token üîë
 
 `code2gist` requires a GitHub token to function. You need to create a new token with the `gist` scope (which allows it to create gists). Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a new token.
 
 Once you have your token, you should store it in the "GITHUB_TOKEN" environment variable. Here are the steps to set this variable in Windows:
 
 1. Open the Control Panel.
 2. Search for "Environment Variables".
 3. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
 4. In the System Properties window that appears, click the "Environment Variables..." button.
 5. In the Environment Variables window, click the "New..." button under the "User variables" section.
 6. Enter "GITHUB_TOKEN" as the variable name and your token as the variable value.
 7. Click "OK" on all open windows to apply the changes.
 
-Please ensure that you have this variable set before using the package.

-## Usage
+## Usage üöÄ
 
-### Uploading Files
+### Uploading Files üì§
 
 To use `code2gist`, simply use the following command:
 
 ```
+Copy code
 code2gist .
 ```
 
 This command will upload all Python files in the current directory to a private Gist on your GitHub account. The Gist will be titled with the name of the current directory, followed by "[code2gist]".
 
 If you want to include files with different extensions, you can specify them using the `--ext` option:
 
 ```
+cssCopy code
 code2gist . --ext .txt .md .py
 ```
 
 This command will include all text, Markdown, and Python files in the upload.
 
-### Deleting Gists
+### Deleting Gists üóëÔ∏è
 
 The `prune` feature allows you to delete all gists created by `code2gist`:
 
 ```
+cssCopy code
 code2gist --prune
 ```
 
 Running this command will delete all your gists with "[code2gist]" in the description.
 
-## .gitignore Support
+## .gitignore Support ‚úÖ
 
 `code2gist` respects `.gitignore` rules. Files that match a rule in the `.gitignore` file of the directory being uploaded will be skipped. In addition, by default, `code2gist` skips files and directories that start with a dot (`.`), although this behavior may change in future versions to strictly adhere to `.gitignore`.
 
-## Note
+## Note üìù
 
 The gists created by `code2gist` are private by default, providing a safe way for you to share your code without making it publicly available.
 
 Please remember that `code2gist` is a tool for sharing code and should not be used to share sensitive information. Always ensure that your files do not contain any confidential data before uploading them.

-#  code2gist
+# code2gist üì¶
 
 `code2gist` is a Python package that makes sharing your code projects easier than ever. With a simple command, it lets you upload your code files to GitHub's Gist. `code2gist` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/code2gist/).
 
-The package works hand-in-hand with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4's 'Browse with Bing' feature. This compatibility allows you to present substantial code bases to the model in a single instance, eliminating the need to split your code into smaller parts.

-## Installation
+## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
 
 You can install the package via pip:
 
 ```
+Copy code
 pip install code2gist
 ```
 
-### Adding code2gist Directory to the PATH Environment Variable
+### Adding code2gist Directory to the PATH Environment Variable üë£
 
 Here are step-by-step instructions to add the code2gist directory to your PATH environment variable on Windows:
 
 1. Open the **Control Panel**.
 2. Navigate to **System and Security > System**.
 3. Click on the **Advanced system settings** link on the left panel.
 4. Click **Environment Variables**.
 5. Under the **System Variables** section, find and double-click the variable **PATH**.
 6. Click **New**.
 7. Add the directory where code2gist is installed. For example, if you have Python 3.11 installed, the directory might look like this: `C:\...\Python311\Scripts`
 8. Click **OK** to close all windows and save the changes.
 
-After following these steps, your system should recognize code2gist commands from any directory in the command line.

-### GitHub Token
+### GitHub Token üîë
 
 `code2gist` requires a GitHub token to function. You need to create a new token with the `gist` scope (which allows it to create gists). Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a new token.
 
 Once you have your token, you should store it in the "GITHUB_TOKEN" environment variable. Here are the steps to set this variable in Windows:
 
 1. Open the Control Panel.
 2. Search for "Environment Variables".
 3. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
 4. In the System Properties window that appears, click the "Environment Variables..." button.
 5. In the Environment Variables window, click the "New..." button under the "User variables" section.
 6. Enter "GITHUB_TOKEN" as the variable name and your token as the variable value.
 7. Click "OK" on all open windows to apply the changes.
 
-Please ensure that you have this variable set before using the package.

-## Usage
+## Usage üöÄ
 
-### Uploading Files
+### Uploading Files üì§
 
 To use `code2gist`, simply use the following command:
 
 ```
+Copy code
 code2gist .
 ```
 
 This command will upload all Python files in the current directory to a private Gist on your GitHub account. The Gist will be titled with the name of the current directory, followed by "[code2gist]".
 
 If you want to include files with different extensions, you can specify them using the `--ext` option:
 
 ```
+cssCopy code
 code2gist . --ext .txt .md .py
 ```
 
 This command will include all text, Markdown, and Python files in the upload.
 
-### Deleting Gists
+### Deleting Gists üóëÔ∏è
 
 The `prune` feature allows you to delete all gists created by `code2gist`:
 
 ```
+cssCopy code
 code2gist --prune
 ```
 
 Running this command will delete all your gists with "[code2gist]" in the description.
 
-## .gitignore Support
+## .gitignore Support ‚úÖ
 
 `code2gist` respects `.gitignore` rules. Files that match a rule in the `.gitignore` file of the directory being uploaded will be skipped. In addition, by default, `code2gist` skips files and directories that start with a dot (`.`), although this behavior may change in future versions to strictly adhere to `.gitignore`.
 
-## Note
+## Note üìù
 
 The gists created by `code2gist` are private by default, providing a safe way for you to share your code without making it publicly available.
 
 Please remember that `code2gist` is a tool for sharing code and should not be used to share sensitive information. Always ensure that your files do not contain any confidential data before uploading them.
